### Introduction

In this blog, we will share how Docker and Jenkins can be installed on a Ubuntu machine by and beginner. we have provided step-by-step guidance for your reference:

### Installing Docker üê≥

1. Open Terminal on your machine and run the below command:
    

```plaintext
sudo apt install docker
```

1. Once Docker is installed you can verify the Docker service status
    

```plaintext
  systemctl status docker

ubuntu@ip-172-31-91-127:~/Learning_Devops/Learning_Devops/Day7$ systemctl status docker
‚óè docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sat 2023-08-12 14:18:27 UTC; 1h 38min ago
```

1. However, If you want to STOP/START/RESTART Docker service you should <mark>use sudo systemctl otherwise the password is required</mark> as shown below
    

```plaintext
systemctl stop docker
ubuntu@ip-172-31-91-127:~/Learning_Devops/Learning_Devops/Day7$ systemctl stop docker
==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.systemd1.manage-units ===
Authentication is required to stop 'docker.service'.
Authenticating as: Ubuntu (ubuntu)
Password:

sudo systemctl stop docker
```

Also while checking running the docker ps command you will get a permission denied error reason is the user is not a member of the docker group

```plaintext
docker ps
ubuntu@ip-172-31-91-127:~/Learning_Devops/Learning_Devops/Day7$ docker ps
Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get "http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json": dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied

#User is added as a member of docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
ubuntu@ip-172-31-91-127:~/Learning_Devops/Learning_Devops/Day7$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

1. Now Restart your machine and docker ps will work fine
    

```plaintext
ubuntu@ip-172-31-91-127:~$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

### **Installing Jenkins** üöÄ

For Ubuntu distribution, there are some pre-requisite that needs to be followed before installing Jenkins.

For Jenkins installation, we have some requirement which we mentioned in below steps and needs to be followed:

```plaintext
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
```

```plaintext
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

```plaintext
sudo apt-get update
```

```plaintext
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

checking service status systemctl status Jenkins

```plaintext
ubuntu@ip-172-31-91-127:~$ systemctl status jenkins
‚óè jenkins.service - Jenkins Continuous Integration Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: activating (start) since Tue 2023-08-15 13:39:17 UTC; 14s ago
   Main PID: 1204 (java)
      Tasks: 40 (limit: 1121)
     Memory: 210.6M
        CPU: 13.967s
     CGroup: /system.slice/jenkins.service
             ‚îî‚îÄ1204 /usr/bin/java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar /usr/share/java/jenkins.war --webroot=/var/cache/jenkins/war --httpP>
```
