**Active Directory**

Active Directory (AD) is a Directory Service developed by Microsoft. It is used to store information about users, computers, and other resources in a network.

It provides us with the following features:

* A distributed databaseÂ 
    
* Authentication and Authorization
    
* Single-sign on
    
* Policy-based Administration
    
* Scalability
    
* Replication
    

**Benefits of using Active Directory Domain Services**

* Authentication: AD can be used to authenticate users and computers to the network.
    
* Authorization: AD can be used to control access to resources on the network.
    
* Replication: AD is replicated to multiple servers(Domain Controllers only) in the network, which ensures that the directory is always available.
    
* Namespace: AD provides a hierarchical namespace for organizing resources in the network.
    

**Tree**

A Tree is a collection of domains that share a common namespace. The domains in a tree are linked together by trust relationships, which allow users and computers in one domain to access resources in other domains. The first domain in a tree is named the Tree Root Domain

**Domain**

An Active Directory Domain is a logical grouping of users, computers, and other resources in a network. A Domain has a single, centralized directory database that contains information about all of the resources in the domain.

**Forest**

An Active Directory Forest is a collection of one or more Domains. The Domains in a Forest are linked together by forest trust relationships, which allow users and computers in one domain to access resources in other domains in the forest.

**Relationship between Tree and Domain**

A tree is a collection of domains, while a domain is a logical grouping of resources in a network. A domain can be part of a tree, or it can be a standalone domain.

**Physical and Logical AD Structure**

In Active Directory, we can have two structures Logical and Physical.

Physical Structure: consist of Sites and Domain Controllers

Logical Structure: consist of Forests, Domain Trees, Domains, Organizational Units, and Objects.

**Conclusion:** Active Directory is the backbone of network administration, providing efficient resource management, enhanced security, and streamlined user access.
