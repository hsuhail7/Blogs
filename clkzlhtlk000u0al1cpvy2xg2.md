**Introduction**

In the world of DevOps, automation plays a pivotal role in driving efficiency, reliability, and speed in software development and IT operations. One of the cornerstones of automation in the DevOps world is "Shell Scripting." This is why it holds immense importance in DevOps practices as helps teams to achieve automation.üîß

**Understanding Shell Scripting**

Shell scripting is the art of writing scripts using commands and utilities provided by the operating system's shell (command-line interpreter). In the context of DevOps, Bash is a popular shell and is used widely. A script is a series of commands and instructions that can be executed sequentially.

**Importance of Shell Scripting in DevOps**

1. **Automation**: Shell scripts allow users to automate tasks that would otherwise require manual intervention, saving time and effort. For example, automating backups, and file transfers. This results in faster and time-saving.
    
2. **Interactivity**: Shell scripts can accept user inputs during execution, making them versatile for dynamic processes based on specific requirements.
    
3. **Efficiency**: Shell scripts facilitate the execution of multiple tasks with a single command. For instance, a single script can combine code compilation, testing, and deployment, reducing manual intervention and errors, and boosting overall efficiency.
    

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

echo " Hello There! "
echo " Enter how many users you want to create "
#Reading user input
read user_number
#For Loop will run based on the user input
for((i=1;i<=$user_number;i++))
do
        echo "Enter user name"
        #user will provide user name which needs to created
        read user_name
        
        #user will be created with a directory under /home location
        sudo useradd -m $user_name
        
        
        echo "Enter new password for user"
        
        #setting password for New Created User
        sudo passwd $user_name
done
        #Showing New User in user location
        cat /etc/passwd
```

**Execution:**

1. Save the script in a file, e.g., `user_creation.sh`.
    
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x user_creation.sh or chmod 744 user_creation.sh`.
    
3. Run the script: `./user_creation.sh`.
